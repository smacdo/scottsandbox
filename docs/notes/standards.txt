Error messages from compilers should look like this:

source-file-name:lineno: message

If you want to mention the column number, use one of these formats:

source-file-name:lineno:column: message
source-file-name:lineno.column: message

Versions
==========
--version

The standard --version option should direct the program to print
information about its name, version, origin and legal status, all on
standard output, and then exit successfully. Other options and arguments
should be ignored once this is seen, and the program should not perform its
normal function.

The first line is meant to be easy for a program to parse; the version
number proper starts after the last space. In addition, it contains the
canonical name for this program, in this format:

GNU Emacs 19.30

The program.s name should be a constant string; don.t compute it from
argv[0]. The idea is to state the standard or canonical name for the
program, not its file name. There are other ways to find out the precise
file name where a command is found in PATH. 

The following line, after the version number line or lines, should be a
copyright notice. If more than one copyright notice is called for, put each
on a separate line.

Next should follow a line stating the license, preferably using one of
abbrevations below, and a brief statement that the program is free software,
and that users are free to copy and change it. Also mention that there is no
warranty, to the extent permitted by law. See recommended wording below.

It is ok to finish the output with a list of the major authors of the
program, as a way of giving credit.

Here.s an example of output that follows these rules:

GNU hello 2.3
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

You should adapt this to your program, of course, filling in the proper year,
copyright holder, name of program, and the references to distribution terms,
and changing the rest of the wording as necessary.

This copyright notice only needs to mention the most recent year in which
changes were made.there.s no need to list the years for previous versions.
changes. You don.t have to mention the name of the program in these notices,
if that is inconvenient, since it appeared in the first line. (The rules are
different for copyright notices in source files; see Copyright Notices in
Information for GNU Maintainers.) 



Help
=================
The standard --help option should output brief documentation for how to
invoke the program, on standard output, then exit successfully. Other
options and arguments should be ignored once this is seen, and the program
should not perform its normal function.

Near the end of the .--help. option.s output, please place lines giving the
email address for bug reports, the package.s home page (normally
<http://www.gnu.org/software/pkg>, and the general page for help using GNU
programs. The format should be like this:

Report bugs to: mailing-address
pkg home page: <http://www.gnu.org/software/pkg/>
General help using GNU software: <http://www.gnu.org/gethelp/>

It is ok to mention other appropriate mailing lists and web pages.
